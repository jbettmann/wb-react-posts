# Posts Challenge

This is a small React-based project built as part of a technical challenge to demonstrate my front-end proficiency with modern development tools and patterns.

## Objective

Create a simple front-end application that:

- Asynchronously fetches post data from an API.
- Displays a loading state while the data is being retrieved.
- Handles and displays errors if the fetch fails.
- Displays an empty state when no posts are returned.
- Displays a list of posts once successfully retrieved.

## Tech Stack

- **React** (via Vite) for fast development and build speed.
- **Tailwind CSS** for utility-first, responsive styling.
- **shadcn/ui** component library for accessible, consistent UI elements.
- **TypeScript** for type safety and maintainability.

## Features Implemented

- Declarative UI built with composable components and styled using TailwindCSS and Shadcn primitives.
- Graceful handling of edge cases with clear UX feedback for loading, error, and empty states.
- Clear, readable code structure designed for scalability and team collaboration.
